# PlayerHeads
This is a King Arthur's Gold mod where players can add their own custom head in-game. Mod inspired by Skinney. Thanks also to Skinney and Bunnie for helping update it over the years. https://forum.thd.vg/resources/player-heads-updated.411/ 

This is a different version where instead of the players having to upload their new head online, it can be added manually by placing it in the game's directory where the mod will automatically send it to all the other clients upon joining a game. This new idea was proposed my Fuzzle.

For more info read the discussion thread on resource linked above. The mod will be updated through the use of the KAG Modding API as it was before. Thanks to everyone who will help with this mod's development.

TODO:
