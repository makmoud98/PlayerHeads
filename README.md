# PlayerHeads
This is a WIP King Arthur's Gold mod where players can add their own custom head in-game. Mod inspired by Skinney. Thanks also to Skinney Bunnie for helping update it over the years. https://forum.thd.vg/resources/player-heads-updated.411/ 
This is a different version where instead of the players having to upload their new head online, it can be added manually by placing it in the game's directory where the mod will automatically send it to all the other clients upon joining a game. This new idea was proposed my Fuzzle. 
Due to many of the game engine's limitations this has proved to be challenging. The first issue is that it is difficult to load textures from the Cache folder. For some reason, the engine just will not allow it. Another issue I ran into is trying to create and load a head without restarting the game. Normally, it seems the game loads all the textures opon launch. Also, I would like for there to be aa way to change your head on the fly, without restarting, but it is not strictly necessary. The issues outlined in here have also been touched on in the comments. 
For more info read the discussion thread on resource linked above. The mod will be updated through the use of the KAG Modding API as it was before. Thanks to everyone who will help with this mod's development.
